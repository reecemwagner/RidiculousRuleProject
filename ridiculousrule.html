   <h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
   <p>I think that having to start school so early in the morning is the most ridiculous rule.</p>
 </p>
 <h2> Research</h2>
 <p>Research shows that school starting as early as it does on a normal day could be dangerous for teens. Things such as drowsy driving due to lack of sleep is dangerous. Sleep deprivation caused by all the homework, work, and other activities we participate in contribute to this problem as well.</p>
